# A-Store-Inventory

TreeHouse Tech Degree Project

Unit 4:

This was a TreeHouse Tech Degree Project

This project was to build a console application that loads an existing 
store's inventory data from a CSV file into a SQlite database. The application
will allow a user to interact with the inventory. They will have 5 options: 
1) View products in the inventory (In the view products option, there is an option to delete a product
  Or return back to the main menu) 
3) Add new products to the inventory
4) Backup the store inventory into a new csv file
5) Search inventory by product ID
6) Exit the inventory program


This was a great project to learn about databases and reading/writing to csv files.
I learned a lot in this project and really enjoyed this one!
