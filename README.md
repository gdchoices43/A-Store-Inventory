# A-Store-Inventory

TreeHouse Tech Degree Project

Unit 4:

This was a TreeHouse Tech Degree Project

This project was to build a console application that loads an existing 
store's inventory data from a CSV file into a SQlite database. The application
will allow a user to interact with the records, add new items, and 
backup/export the existing state of the database into a CSV file.
